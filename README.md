# üîê Windows 10 Compliance Hardening (NIST 800-53 Aligned)

> A hands-on lab where I hardened a misconfigured Windows 10 Pro VM, scanned it using Nessus Essentials from an Ubuntu 22.04 VM, and remediated several medium/high vulnerabilities using PowerShell and registry edits. This project is an implementation of RMF Step 4: Assess Security Controls, using system hardening techniques aligned with NIST 800-53 standards.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Lab Environment

| Component         | Details                      |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Hypervisor       | Azure (Student Subscription) |
| Target VM        | Windows 10 Pro               |
| Scanner VM       | Ubuntu 22.04                 |
| Scanner Tool     | Nessus Essentials            |
| Remediation Tool | PowerShell (Admin)           |
| Network Config   | Shared virtual network (VNet) with private IPs |

## Preparation:

Before scanning or remediating the system, I performed the following steps to prepare the lab environment:

- Deployed two Azure VMs:  
  - **Windows 10 Pro** (system with intentional misconfigurations)  
  - **Ubuntu 22.04** (scanner machine running Nessus Essentials)

- Created a **shared virtual network** so the scanner could reach the target via private IP

- Installed **Nessus Essentials** on Ubuntu using the correct `.deb` package

## Scenario:

During an internal security audit, a Windows 10 Pro workstation image was found being used across several internal machines. This image had originally been deployed by IT for temporary contractor workstations but had never gone through formal security hardening or baseline validation.

I was tasked with scanning the system, identifying compliance gaps, and remediating misconfigurations based on best practices aligned to NIST 800-53 and the RMF control assessment step (Step 4).

The goal was to bring the system into compliance with internal hardening standards, while also documenting the before/after states for audit reporting and future automation planning.

## üö® Initial Vulnerability Scan (Before Hardening)

Using Nessus Essentials, I scanned the misconfigured Windows 10 VM and discovered the following:

| Plugin ID | Name                                      | Severity |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| 42873     | SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites (3DES)  | High     |
| 104743    | TLS Version 1.0 Protocol Detected         | Medium   |
| 157288    | TLS Version 1.1 Protocol Detected         | Medium   |
| 57608     | SMB Signing Not Required                  | Medium   |
| 51192     | SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted         | Medium   |
| 57582     | SSL Self-Signed Certificate               | Medium   |

## üîß Remediation Actions

All remediations were applied manually using **PowerShell (Admin)** sessions and custom scripts.

| Plugin(s) Fixed     | Fix Description                          | Method        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 104743, 157288      | Disabled TLS 1.0 and 1.1                  | PowerShell     |
| 42873               | Disabled 3DES/RC4 (SWEET32)               | PowerShell     |

## üìÑ Scripts Used

| Script Name             | Purpose                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `disable-tls.ps1`       | Disable TLS 1.0/1.1, enable TLS 1.2   |
| `Fix_SWEET32_SMB.ps1`   | Disable weak ciphers, enforce SMB signing |
| `Fix_Certs.ps1`         | Create and bind lab CA + RDP cert (optional) |

---

## Note on PowerShell Scripts

During the hardening process, I created several PowerShell scripts to apply security settings such as disabling insecure protocols, enforcing SMB signing, and modifying registry keys.

Since these scripts were saved directly to the VM (either from the browser or through file transfer), Windows automatically flagged them as potentially unsafe ‚Äî a built-in security feature known as the Zone Identifier or "Mark of the Web."

As a result, PowerShell blocked the scripts from running by default, even when I had administrative privileges.

To fix this, I had to manually unblock each script. This is a common step in environments where scripts are shared or downloaded. I used this PowerShell script to allow the scripts to run (of course changing the file name appropriately):

```
Unblock-File -Path "C:\Users\mmach\Desktop\Fix_TLS.ps1"
```

## ‚úÖ Final Scan Results (After Hardening)

After applying the remediations, I performed a new Nessus scan. These findings were resolved:

| Plugin ID | Status      |
|-----------|-------------|
| 42873     | ‚úÖ Fixed     |
| 104743    | ‚úÖ Fixed     |
| 157288    | ‚úÖ Fixed     |
| 57608     | ‚úÖ Fixed     |

### üß† Reflection

This project simulates how real-world misconfigurations are identified and remediated. I not only learned how to interpret Nessus scan results, but also how to apply safe, targeted fixes using PowerShell in alignment with industry-standard frameworks like NIST 800-53 and the RMF process.

I also had to think critically about which vulnerabilities truly needed to be remediated (e.g., TLS, SMB signing, SWEET32), and which were acceptable to leave in place in an internal lab setting (e.g., certificate trust warnings). Overall, this project helped me connect technical security work with the broader goals of compliance, documentation, and system hardening.
